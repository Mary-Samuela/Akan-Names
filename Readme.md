Description
The Akan Name Generator is a web-based application inspired by the Ghanaian Akan tradition of naming children according to the day of the week they are born.
By simply entering your date of birth and selecting your gender, the application calculates the day of the week you were born and assigns you the corresponding Akan name.
This project is educational and cultural, aimed at helping users learn about Akan naming traditions while exploring the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a fun and interactive way.
Technologies Used
•	HTML – for structuring the page.
•	CSS – for styling and layout.
•	JavaScript – for logic to calculate days of the week and generate Akan names.
